\section{Motivation}
As seen before beam-based corrections and the $b_4$ in WISE 
\cite{AcceleratorTechnologyDepartmentWindowsInterfaceSimulation} agree well 
for IR1 but not for IR5 \cite{MacleanBeambasedVsModel2019}.
Ezio gathered for that reason the original data from the magnet reports 
\cite{TodescoFidelReportPartII} and there the values for IR5 are 
different from the WISE errors and closer to the beam-based
measurements \cite{TodescoB4MQXAMQXB2020}.

A check for the values of $b_6$ between these documents and WISE 
is done in this note.
Additionally the values from the ID-cards is compared.
