Since opening up a new energy frontier for exploration in 2010, it has gathered a global user community working in fundamental particle physics and the physics of hadronic matter at extreme temperature and density. To sustain and extend its discovery potential, the LHC will undergo a major upgrade in the 2020s. This will increase its rate of collisions by a factor of five beyond the original design value and the integrated luminosity by a factor ten. The new configuration, known as High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), will rely on a number of key innovations that push accelerator technology beyond its present limits. Among these are cutting-edge 11–12 T superconducting magnets, including Nb 3 Sn-based magnets never used in accelerators before, compact superconducting cavities for longitudinal beam rotation, new technology and physical processes for beam collimation. The dynamics of the HL-LHC beams will be also particularly challenging and this aspect is the main focus of this paper.},

For the HL-LHC the larger crossing angle together with a smaller beta function at the collision point would result in more than 70\% luminosity loss due to the incomplete geometric overlap of colliding bunches. To recover head-on collisions at the high-luminosity particle-physics detectors ATLAS and CMS and benefit from the very low β∗ provided by the Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing (ATS) optics, a local crab cavity scheme provides transverse kicks to the proton bunches. The tight space constraints at the location of these cavities leads to designs which are axially non-symmetric, giving rise to high order multipoles components of the main deflecting mode and, since these kicks are harmonic in time, we expand them in a series of multipoles in a similar fashion as is done for static field magnets. In this work we calculate, for the first time, the higher order multipoles and their impact on beam dynamics for three different crab cavity prototypes. Different approaches to calculate the multipoles are presented. Furthermore, we perform the first calculation of their impact on the long term stability of the machine using the concept of dynamic aperture.},

The motivation arises in the possibility of finding a method to reliably extrapolate the results of numerical simulations well beyond what is currently possible in terms of CPU time. In earlier work, a proposal for a model based on Nekhoroshev theorem and Kolmogorov--Arnold--Moser theory was made. This model has been studied in detail and proved successful in describing the evolution of the dynamic aperture in numerical simulations, however, a number of shortcomings had been identified and new models are proposed in this paper, which solve the observed issues. The new models have been benchmarked against numerical simulations for a simple system, the 4D H\textbackslash{}'enon map, as well as a realistic, non-linear representation of the beam dynamics in the LHC at 6.5 TeV providing in both cases excellent results.},

It was recently shown that this problem can be solved in polynomial time via convex relaxation, under some conditions on the noise. In this paper, under similar but more restrictive conditions, we show that a modified version of the power method converges to the global optimum. This is simpler and (empirically) faster than convex approaches. Empirically, they both succeed in the same regime. Further analysis shows that, in the same noise regime as previously studied, secondorder necessary optimality conditions for this quadratically constrained quadratic program are also sufficient, despite nonconvexity.},

This equivalent kick is used to find the strengths that certain normal and skew quadrupoles located on the IR must have to make an effective correction in that region. Additionally, averaging techniques to reduce noise on beam position data, which allows precise estimates of equivalent kicks, are presented and mathematically justified. The complete procedure is tested with simulated data obtained from madx and 2015-LHC experimental data. The analyses performed in the experimental data indicate that the strengths of the IR skew quadrupole correctors and normal quadrupole correctors can be estimated within a 10\% uncertainty. Finally, the effect of IR corrections in the β∗ is studied, and a correction scheme that returns this parameter to its designed value is proposed.},

In the LHC, k modulation of the closest quadrupoles to the interaction point (IP) is the most accurate method to measure β∗ at the IP.

Furthermore it presents a new analytical method for the calculation of β∗ using k modulation.},

increasingly challenging regimes of operation, as well as for the High Luminosity LHC where machine
nonlinearities will have a significantly larger impact. Limitations of traditional excitation methods at top
energy, in particular due to machine protection, have pushed the development of safe alternative methods
using ac dipoles to characterize the nonlinear content of the LHC. One of the methods that has been proposed
is the dynamic aperture under forced oscillation of ac dipoles. This new observable has the potential to help
characterize relative changes in the nonlinear content of the machine, improve the understanding of the
nonlinear models by comparing to simulations, validate nonlinear optics corrections, and give a qualitative
lower bound estimate on the free dynamic aperture. This paper presents the first experimental demonstration
of forced dynamic aperture measurements under forced oscillations performed using the LHC ac dipoles, and
discusses the benefits of forced dynamic aperture measurements in circular colliders.},

  abstract = {The equations of motion of the particles in a synchrotron in which the field gradient index n=−(rB)∂B∂r varies along the equilibrium orbit are examined on the basis of the linear approximation. It is shown that if n alternates rapidly between large positive and large negative values, the stability of both radial and vertical oscillations can be greatly increased compared to conventional accelerators in which n is azimuthally constant and must lie between 0 and 1. Thus aperture requirements are reduced. For practical designs, the improvement is limited by the effects of constructional errors; these lead to resonance excitation of oscillations and consequent instability if 2νx or 2νz or νx + νz is integral, where νx and νz are the frequencies of horizontal and vertical betatron oscillations, measured in units of the frequency of revolution. The mechanism of phase stability is essentially the same as in a conventional synchrotron, but the radial amplitude of synchrotron oscillations is reduced substantially. Furthermore, at a “transition energy” E1 ≈ νxMc2 the stable and unstable equilibrium phases exchange roles, necessitating a jump in the phase of the radiofrequency accelerating voltage. Calculations indicate that the manner in which this jump is performed is not very critical.},

  abstract = {We model the build-up of inter-channel nonlinear interference noise (NLIN) in wavelength division multiplexed systems by considering the pulse collision dynamics in the time domain. The fundamental interactions can be classified as two-pulse, three-pulse, or four-pulse collisions and they can be either complete, or incomplete. Each type of collision is shown to have its unique signature and the overall nature of NLIN is determined by the relative importance of the various classes of pulse collisions in a given WDM system. The pulse-collision picture provides qualitative and quantitative insight into the character of NLIN, offering a simple and intuitive explanation to all of the reported and previously unexplained phenomena. In particular, we show that the most important contributions to NLIN follow from two-pulse and four-pulse collisions. While the contribution of two-pulse collisions is in the form of phase-noise and polarization-state-rotation with strong dependence on modulation format, four-pulse collisions generate complex circular noise whose variance is independent of modulation format. In addition, two-pulse collisions are strongest when the collision is complete, whereas four-pulse collisions are strongest when the collision is incomplete. We show that two-pulse collisions dominate the formation of NLIN in short links with lumped amplification, or in links with distributed amplification extending over arbitrary length. In long links using lumped amplification the relative significance of four-pulse collisions increases, emphasizing the circularity of the NLIN while reducing its dependence on modulation format.},

This way the picket fence effect is reduced and a better approximation of DTFT local peaks is achieved for a finite number of measured points. In order to overcome the high computational demand problem of the zero padding method, an alternative one, is further presented in this paper. This method, making use of non-integer number of cycles in DFT kernel orthogonal signals, provide the same results in spectral analysis as zero padding method but with significant reduction of the computational effort. Moreover, the use of non-integer arguments for DFT evaluation open the possibility to develop DFT with variable bins resolution, narrow band DFT and bins interpolation algorithms.},

  abstract = {The Achromatic Telescopic Squeezing (ATS) scheme is a novel squeezing mechanism, which is (almost fully) compatible with the existing hardware of the LHC, and enables both the production and the chromatic correction of very low β*. The basic principles of the ATS scheme will be reminded together with its basic motivation which is to deliver a very ambitious β* of 10-15 cm in view of the even more ambitious performance commitments taken by the HL-LHC project. In this context, a few dedicated beam experiments were meticulously prepared and took place at the LHC in 2011. The results obtained will be highlighted, demonstrating already the viability of the scheme. The plans for 2012 will be discussed, with a few optics considerations which could already justify the implementation of the ATS scheme in the nominal machine, depending on which β* limits will be met first, and that the ATS can solve (e.g. optics matchability, chromatic aberrations) and obviously cannot: the aperture of the existing triplet.},

  abstract = {The field of artificial intelligence is driven by the goal to provide machines with human-like intelligence. However modern science is currently facing problems with high complexity that cannot be solved by humans in the same timescale as by machines. Therefore there is a demand on automation of complex tasks. To identify the category of tasks which can be performed by machines in the domain of optics measurements and correction on the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is one of the central research subjects of this thesis. The application of machine learning methods and concepts of artificial intelligence can be found in various industry and scientific branches. In High Energy Physics these concepts are mostly used in offline analysis of experiments data and to perform regression tasks. In Accelerator Physics the machine learning approach has not found a wide application yet. Therefore potential tasks for machine learning solutions can be specified in this domain. The appropriate methods and their suitability for given requirements are to be investigated. The general question of this thesis is to identify the opportunities to apply machine learning methods to find and correct the errors in LHC optics and also to speed up beam measurements},

  abstract = {This is a description of the basic ideas behind the “Polymorphic Tracking Code” or PTC. PTC
is truly a “kick code” or symplectic integrator in the tradition of TRACYII, SixTrack, and TEAPOT.
However it separates correctly the mathematical atlas of charts and the magnets at a structural level
by implementing a “restricted fibre bundle.” The resulting structures allow backward propagation
and recirculation, something not possible in standard tracking codes.
Also PTC is polymorphic in handling real (single, double and even quadruple precision) and
Taylor series. Therefore it has all the tools associated to the TPSA packages: Lie methods, Normal
Forms, Cosy-Infinity capabilities, beam envelopesfor radiation, etc., as well as parameter dependence
on-the-fly. However PTC is an integrator, and as such, one must, generally, adhere to the Talman
“exactness” view of modelling. Incidentally, it supports exact sector and rectangular bends as well.
Of course, one can certainly bypass its integrator and the user is free to violate Talman’s principles
on his own; PTC provides the tools to dig one’s grave but not the encouragement.
The reader will find in Appendix B a PowerPoint presentation of FPP. The presentation is a bit
out of date but it gives a good idea of FPP which is essential to PTC. FPP is a stand-alone library and
can be used by anyone with a FORTRAN90 compiler.
This presentation is also, to be honest, a place where the authors intend to document very incompletely
nearly two years of work: the development of FPP and subsequently that of PTC.
Our ultimate intention is to morph PTC completely into MAD-X. The code MAD-X is an upgrade
of MAD-8 and not of the C++ CLASSIC based code MAD-9. The present document does not address
when and how this will be done. It is also our goal to link, if possible, PTC with CAD programs for
the design of complex follow-the-terrain beam lines. So far FPP and PTC have been used in the
design of beam separators (complex polymorphs) and recirculators. They have also been linked with
the code BMAD from Cornell. There is still a lot of work to be done if these tools are to be generally
usable by a wide range of people.
In addition, more complex structures will be needed to handle effects beyond single particle
dynamics in a way which respects the fundamental mathematical integrity of the structures of PTC.},

  abstract = {Beam lifetime in storage rings and colliders is affected by, among other effects, lattice nonlinearities. Their control are of great benefit to the dynamic aperture of an accelerator, whose enlargement leads in general to more efficient injection and longer lifetime. This article describes a procedure to evaluate and correct unwanted nonlinearities by using turn-by-turn beam position monitor data, which is an evolution of previous works on the resonance driving terms (RDTs). Effective sextupole magnetic errors and tilts at the ESRF electron storage ring are evaluated and corrected (when possible) by using this technique. For the first time, also octupolar RDTs could be measured and used to define an octupolar model for the main quadrupoles. Most of the deviations from the model observed in the sextupolar RDTs of the ESRF storage ring turned out to be generated by focusing errors rather than by sextupole errors. These results could be achieved thanks to new analytical formulas describing the harmonic content of the nonlinear betatron motion to the second order. For the first time, RDTs have been also used for beam-based calibration of individual sextupole magnets. They also proved to be a powerful tool in predicting faulty magnets and in validating magnetic models. This technique provides also a figure of merit for a self-assessment of the reliability of the data analysis.},

  abstract = {In this thesis a beam-based method has been developed to measure the strength and the polarity of corrector magnets (skew quadrupoles and sextupoles) in circular accelerators. The algorithm is based on the harmonic analysis (via FFT) of beam position monitor (BPM) data taken turn by turn from an accelerator in operation. It has been shown that, from the differences of the spectral line amplitudes between two consecutive BPMs, both the strength and the polarity of non-linear elements placed in between can be measured. The method has been successfully tested using existing BPM data from the SPS of CERN, since presently the SIS-18 is not equipped with the necessary hardware. The magnet strength of seven SPS extraction sextupoles was measured with a precision of about 10\%. The polarities have been unambiguously measured. This method can be used to detect polarity errors and wrong power supply connections during machine commissioning, as well as for a continuous monitoring of the "nonlinearity budget" in superconducting machines. A second beam-based method has been studied for a fast measurement and correction of betatron coupling driven by skew quadrupole field errors and tilted focusing quadrupoles. Traditional methods usually require a time-consuming scan of the corrector magnets in order to minimize the coupling stop band |C|. In this thesis it has been shown how the same correction can be performed in a single machine cycle from the harmonic analysis of multi-BPM data. The method has been successfully applied to RHIC. It has been shown that the stop band |C| (also known in the American literature as Delta-Qmin) measured in a single machine cycle with the new algorithm is compatible with the value obtained by traditional methods. The measurement of the resonance phase Theta defines automatically the best corrector setting, which was found in agreement with the one obtained with a traditional scan. A third theoretical achievement is a new description of the betatron motion close to the difference resonance in presence of linear coupling. Compared to the matrix formalism the motion is parametrized as a function of the resonance driving term f1001 only (which is proven to be an observable), whereas making use of the matrix approach four parameters need to be measured. Formulae describing the exchange of RMS emittances when approaching the resonances have been already derived in the 70s in the smooth approximation. New formulae have been derived here making use of Lie algebra providing a better description of the emittance behavior. The emittance exchange curves are predicted by new formulae with excellent agreement with multi-particle simulations and the counter-intuitive emittance variation along the ring of the emittance is proven to be related to the variation of f1001. A new way to decouple the equations of motion and explicit expressions for the individual single particle invariants have been found. For the first time emittance exchange studies have been carried out in the SIS-18 of GSI. Transverse RMS emittances have been measured during 2005 from rest gas monitor (RGM) data. Crossing the linear coupling resonance, the transverse emittances exchange completely. It has been observed that this effect is reversible. Applications of this manipulation are: emittance equilibration under consideration for future operations of the SIS-18 as booster for the SIS-100; emittance transfer during multi-turn injection to improve the eficiency and to protect the injection septum in high intensity operations, by shifting part of the horizontal emittance into the vertical plane. The emittance exchange curves obtained experimentally have been compared with analytic formulae providing a fast measurement (in few machine cycles only) of the linear coupling stop band |C|. Technical problems prevented the use of the eight skew quadrupoles installed in the SIS-18 to compensate the linear coupling resonance. It has been observed that the emittance exchange curve is highly sensitive to the beam intensity. Multi-particle simulations with 2D PIC space-charge solver have been run to infer heuristic scaling laws able to quantify the observable stop band, to be used for the resonance compensation. The analysis of BPM and RGM data has been performed making use of new software applications developed for this purpose. The bpm2rdt code for the harmonic analysis of BPM data has been written and tested with real data. The software reads the BPM turn-by-turn data and the Twiss parameters. Then it performs the FFT of these data, finds the peaks of the Fourier spectra and infers the RDT fjklm, the strengths \^hjklm and the local terms lambda-jklm. All these observables are printed out together with the corresponding values of the model, computed from the nominal values of strengths and the Twiss parameters. From the FFT of dual-plane BPM data the linear optics (beta functions and phase advances Delta phi) at the corresponding location is also inferred. From the measurement of f1000, the linear coupling coeffcient C (amplitude and phase) is also computed. The code has been tested by using existing SPS data and new RHIC data. For the on-line analysis of RGM data the rgm2emitt code has been written. The application reads in input the raw data files from the RGM and the beam loss monitor (BLM) respectively, the latter created by the RGM on-line software itself. From the RGM data the transverse beam sizes and emittances are inferred and used together with the BLM data to compute the tune shift during the machine cycle.},

  abstract = {Maximization of the dynamic aperture and Landau damping of the collective instabilities are partly con icting requirements. On the one hand, the non-linearities of the lattice must be minimized at large oscillation amplitude to guarantee the stability of the single particle motion. On the other hand, a spread of the betatron frequencies is needed for the stability of the collective motion of bunches of particles this requires non-linearities e ective at small amplitudes. We show in this note that the `natural' spread of betatron tunes due to the eld imperfections is inadequate for Landau damping. An octupole scheme is required to provide collective stability at high energy. At low energy it may be used to nd the optimum between the correction of the octupolar eld imperfections and Landau damping. The solution of the stability problem taking into account the two degrees of freedom of the transverse motion allows a signi cant saving in octupole strength even though a safety margin is included: 144 octupoles with a magnetic length of 32 cm are needed, leaving some reserve slots for other correctors. The present localization close to the lattice quadrupoles is well adapted for Landau damping, but unfavourable for the correction of the octupolar imperfection of the dipoles. Depending on the multipolar errors in the dipoles, octupolar and skew octupolar spool pieces may have to be envisaged.},

  abstract = {The fractional part of the tune value of a circular accelerator can be measured by observing the betatron oscillations of the beam on a position sensitive pick-up. In the frequency domain the betatron signal is seen as sidebands on the revolution harmonics. The bunches in the beam often have a very short length with respect to the revolution period, resulting in a wideband pick-up signal spectrum, containing many betatron lines. Classical tune measurement systems filter out just one or a few of these betatron sidebands. As a consequence, most of the betatron energy is lost and only a very small fraction remains for further processing. This paper describes a new method, referred to as Direct Diode Detection (3D), which overcomes this and a few other problems. The basic idea is to time stretch the beam pulses from the pick up in order to increase the betatron frequency content in the baseband. This can be accomplished by a simple diode detector followed by an RC low pass filter, as used in the common envelope detection technique for demodulating AM signals. It will be shown that such a circuit can increase the betatron signal level by orders of magnitude compared to classical systems. The 3D method was recently tested in the CERN SPS and PS machines with prototype base band tune (BBQ) measurement systems. Results will be presented showing that the prototypes were sensitive enough to see betatron oscillations in both machines with no added external excitation. The SPS system is also shown to be capable of measuring tunes with a resolution of 10-5 with no explicit excitation. Copies of the BBQ prototype are currently being tested on BNL-RHIC and FNAL-Tevatron as part of the US LARP collaboration, with a view to installing a similar system for tune measurement at the LHC},

With an improved algorithm the measurement precision has achieved 1 mrad (rms), or equivalently, 0.3\% of beta beat at NSLS-II. The beta beating can be corrected to 1\% in less than half an hour. This precise technique can be applied to the nonlinear lattice correction as well. The betatron phase probed by an off-axis beam provides information on the sextupole strength. In comparison with the model the nominal strength can be restored. It was shown that the proposed scheme treated all the leading order resonance driving terms generated by sextupoles, as well as the detuning terms and the nonlinear chromaticity. At NSLS-II a half percent sextupole correction led to a 15\% increase of the dynamic aperture.},

  abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximations, such as the truncated singular value decomposition and the rank-revealing QR decomposition, play a central role in data analysis and scientific computing. This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed—either explicitly or implicitly—to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, robustness, and/or speed. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis. The specific benefits of randomized techniques depend on the computational environment. Consider the model problem of finding the k dominant components of the singular value decomposition of an \$m \textbackslash{}times n\$ matrix. (i) For a dense input matrix, randomized algorithms require \$\textbackslash{}bigO(mn \textbackslash{}log(k))\$ floating-point operations (flops) in contrast to \$ \textbackslash{}bigO(mnk)\$ for classical algorithms. (ii) For a sparse input matrix, the flop count matches classical Krylov subspace methods, but the randomized approach is more robust and can easily be reorganized to exploit multiprocessor architectures. (iii) For a matrix that is too large to fit in fast memory, the randomized techniques require only a constant number of passes over the data, as opposed to \$\textbackslash{}bigO(k)\$ passes for classical algorithms. In fact, it is sometimes possible to perform matrix approximation with a single pass over the data.},

  abstract = {We present an extension to the model-free anomaly detection algorithm, Isolation Forest. This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), improves the consistency and reliability of the anomaly score produced for a given data point. We show that the standard Isolation Forest produces inconsistent scores using score maps. The score maps suffer from an artifact generated as a result of how the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree is selected. We propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias introduced in the algorithm. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in improved score maps. We show that the consistency and reliability of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant score lines. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF, which highlights its potential as anomaly detection algorithm.},

It aims at achieving a center of mass energy of 27 TeV, almost doubling the design c.o.m. energy of the LHC. This increase in energy relies on the use of 16 T Nb3Sn dipoles to be developed for the FCC-hh. The field quality of these dipoles is expected to have a big impact on the Dynamic Aperture (DA) at injection energy and subsequently tracking studies are conducted to evaluate the impact of magnetic field errors on the beam dynamics. In the following the results of these studies for the different injection energies considered for the HE-LHC are presented and a possible strategy for increasing the DA is discussed.},

  abstract = {The fourth one-month Pb-Pb collision run brought LHC Run 2 to an end in December 2018. Following the tendency to reduce dependence on the configuration of the preceding proton run, a completely new optics cycle with the strongest ever focussing at the ALICE and LHCb experiments was designed and rapidly implemented, demonstrating the maturity of the collider’s operating modes. Beam-loss monitor thresholds were carefully adjusted to provide optimal protection from the multiple loss mechanisms in heavy-ion operation. A switch from a basic bunch-spacing of 100 ns to 75 ns was made as the beam became available from the injector chain. A new record luminosity, 6 times the original design and close to the operating value proposed for HL-LHC, provided validation of the strategy for mitigating quenches due to bound-free pair production (BFPP) at the interaction points of the ATLAS and CMS experiments. Most of the beam parameters of the HL-LHC Pb-Pb upgrade were attained during this run and the integrated luminosity goals for the first 10 years of LHC operation were substantially exceeded.},

Designing the HE-LHC results in a trade off between energy reach, beam stay clear as well as geometry offset with respect to the LHC. In order to best meet the requirements, various arc cell and dispersion suppressor options have been generated and analysed, before concluding on two baseline options, which are presented in this paper.

Several measurement techniques for optics functions are used in the LHC to provide the most suitable method for a given scenario. A new tool to run k-modulation measurements and analysis is being developed with the aim to be fully automatic and online. It will take constraints of various systems such as tune measurement precision, powering limits of the LHC superconducting circuits and limits of their quench protection systems into account. It will also provide the possibility to sinusoidally modulate the currents of the investigated quadrupoles with a predefined frequency and amplitude to increase the measurement precision further. This paper will review the advantages and limitations of k-modulation measurements in the LHC with and without sinusoidal current modulation. The used algorithms and tools will be presented and estimates on the obtainable beta function measurement precision will be given.},

  abstract = {The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is currently the world's largest particle accelerator with the highest center of mass energy in particle collision experiments. The control of the particle beam focusing is essential for the performance reach of such an accelerator. For the characterization of the focusing properties at the LHC, turn-by-turn beam position data is simultaneously recorded at numerous measurement devices (BPMs) along the accelerator, while an oscillation is excited on the beam. A novel analysis method for these measurements (\$N\$-BPM method) is developed here, which is based on a detailed analysis of systematic and statistical error sources and their correlations. It has been applied during the commissioning of the LHC for operation at an unprecedented energy of 6.5 TeV. In this process a stronger focusing than its design specifications has been achieved. This results in smaller transverse beam sizes at the collision points and allows for a higher rate of particle collisions. For the derivation of the focusing parameters at many synchrotron light sources, the change of the beam orbit is observed, which is induced by deliberate changes of magnetic fields (orbit response matrix). In contrast, the analysis of turn-by-turn beam position measurements is for many of these machines less precise due to the distance between two BPMs. The \$N\$-BPM method overcomes this limitation by allowing to include the measurement data from more BPMs in the analysis. It has been applied at the ALBA synchrotron light source and compared to the orbit response method. The significantly faster measurement with the \$N\$-BPM method is a considerable advantage in this case.  Finally, an outlook is given to the challenges which lie ahead for the control of the beam focusing at the HL-LHC, which is a future major upgrade of the LHC.},

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

It sets out to quantify the understanding of the non-linear beam dynamics through the comparison of beam-based measurements to simulation, and where able and appropriate seeks to explain deviations of measurement from the model, and define corrections for relevant aspects of the dynamics. The analyses presented in this thesis represent considerable advances in the understanding of the LHC beam dynamics which should allow for an improved operation of the machine in the coming years.},

  abstract = {In 2017, optics commissioning strategy for low-β∗ operation of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) underwent a major revision. This was prompted by a need to extend the scope of beam-based commissioning at high-energy, beyond the exclusively linear realm considered previously, and into the nonlinear regime. It also stemmed from a recognition that, due to operation with crossing angles in the experimental insertions, the linear and nonlinear optics quality were intrinsically linked through potentially significant feed-down at these locations. Following the usual linear optics commissioning therefore, corrections for (normal and skew) sextupole and (normal and skew) octupole errors in the high-luminosity insertions were implemented. For the first time, the LHC now operates at top-energy with beam-based corrections for nonlinear dynamics, and for the effect of the crossing-scheme on beta-beating and dispersion. The new commissioning procedure has improved the control of various linear and nonlinear characteristics of the LHC, yielding clear operational benefits. This report gives a detailed account of the beam-based measurements carried out during the experimental campaigns},

  abstract = {Nonlinear magnetic errors in low-β insertions can contribute significantly to detuning with amplitude, linear and nonlinear chromaticity, and lead to degradation of dynamic aperture and beam lifetime. As such, the correction of nonlinear errors in the experimental insertions of colliders can be of critical significance for successful operation. This is expected to be of particular relevance to the LHC’s second run and its high luminosity upgrade, as well as to future colliders such as the Future Circular Collider. Current correction strategies envisioned for these colliders assume it will be possible to calculate optimized local corrections through the insertions, using a magnetic model of the errors. This paper shows however, that reliance purely upon magnetic measurements of the nonlinear errors of insertion elements is insufficient to guarantee a good correction quality in the relevant low-β* regime. It is possible to perform beam-based examination of nonlinear magnetic errors via the feed-down to readily observed beam properties upon application of closed orbit bumps, and methods based upon feed-down to tune have been utilized at RHIC, SIS18, and SPS. This paper demonstrates the extension of such methodology to include direct observation of feed-down to linear coupling in the LHC. It is further shown that such beam-based studies can be used to complement magnetic measurements performed during LHC construction, in order to validate and refine the magnetic model of the collider. Results from first attempts of the measurement and correction of nonlinear errors in the LHC experimental insertions are presented. Several discrepancies of beam-based studies with respect to the LHC magnetic model are reported.},

Nonlinear dynamics was already well mastered, e.g., in the close field of celestial mechanics as similar problems had been considered and successfully tackled. Hence, several results were available to aid comprehension of the behavior of charged particle beams under the influence of nonlinear forces. Here, we discuss how concepts derived from the theory of dynamical systems, linked with the fundamental Kolmogorov–Arnold–Moser theory and Nekhoroshev theorem, can be successfully applied to the analysis of nonlinear motion of charged particles in a circular accelerator. Based on these ideas, an innovative method to measure the extent of the phase-space region within which bounded motion occurs is presented, which has been successfully tested for the first time at the CERN LHC.},

  abstract = {The nonlinear dynamics of a circular accelerator such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) may significantly impact its performance. As the LHC progresses to more challenging regimes of operation it is to be expected that the nonlinear single particle dynamics in the transverse planes will play an increasing role in limiting the reach of the accelerator. As such it is vital that the nonlinear sources are well understood. The nonlinear fields of a circular accelerator may be probed through measurement of the amplitude detuning: the variation of tune with single particle emittance. This quantity may be assessed experimentally by exciting the beam to large amplitudes with kicks, and obtaining the tunes and actions from turn-by-turn data at Beam Position Monitors. The large amplitude excitations inherent to such a measurement also facilitate measurement of the dynamic aperture from an analysis of beam losses following the kicks. In 2012 these measurements were performed on the LHC Beam 2 at injection energy (450 GeV) with the nominal magnetic configuration. Nonlinear coupling was also observed. A second set of measurements were performed following the application of corrections for b4 and b5 errors. Analysis of the experimental results, and a comparison to simulation are presented herein.},

As β∗ is reduced however, the impact of nonlinear errors in experimental insertions may become sizable. Below β∗ = 0.8 m, and in particular with possible LHC configurations approaching 0.3 m, an operational impact from uncompensated nonlinear errors in the IRs is to be expected. Notably the contribution of normal octupole errors in IR1 and IR5 to the tune footprint becomes comparable to that created by the Landau octupoles, with implications for the performance of instrumentation and Landau damping of instabilities. In the HL-LHC compensation of IR-nonlinear sources may become a critical issue, with feed-down from IR-sextupole errors having the potential to generate substantial linear optics perturbations. This effect will require an evolution of the linear optics commissioning strategy in the LHC and HL-LHC. Current understanding of the impact of these errors and our ability to correct them will be reported. Nonlinear optics commissioning activities undertaken elsewhere in the machine cycle will also be introduced.},

  abstract = {Precise control of beam optics and beam stability is of critical importance for machine protection and performance of today's high-energy particle accelerators. For the next generation of accelerators, the tolerances are even tighter.  This thesis presents new methods and improved techniques to efficiently identify, measure and correct a range of errors in particle accelerators. Circular and linear accelerators have been studied in parallel.  The Circular Large Hadron Collider (LHC) collides mostly protons at energies of 6.5 TeV and European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) storage ring accelerates electrons to produce synchrotron light. The Compact Linear Collider (CLIC) will provide electron-positron collisions at centre of mass energies up to 3 TeV. In CLIC, a non-colliding beam, referred to as drive beam, generates RF power to accelerate the main beam. LHC's optics measurement scheme was improved, also by studying ESRF. This resulted in significantly improved \$\textbackslash{}beta\$-function  measurement, achieving twice the best-documented precision so far.  The optics correction algorithm was improved allowing \$\textbackslash{}beta\$-beating in the LHC to systematically reach a level below 1.8\% rms.  An adiabatic simultaneous 3-dimensional beam excitation, which combines AC-dipoles  with RF-frequency modulation, significantly sped up beam optics measurements.  The analysis of beam frequency spectra from turn-by-turn data was also made   significantly faster, in the LHC by a factor \$\textbackslash{}sim 300\$. These results contributed to LHC's excellent performance beyond its designed targets.  They also contributed towards its upgrade the High Luminosity LHC.  CLIC has stringent requirements on drive beam stability in terms of beam current, energy and phase. In the CLIC Test Facility 3 (CTF3), a novel algorithm to identify drifts and correlations was developed and applied in a study of drive beam stabilisation. The underlying causes of drifts were found and multiple beam-based feedbacks were developed and commissioned in CTF3, in this way achieving the stability goals. These improvements therefore played a key role in demonstrating the viability of CLIC in terms of drive beam stability.},

The ILSF storage ring design is based on a five-bend achromat lattice providing an ultralow horizontal beam emittance of 0.27 nm-rad. Inevitable errors like imperfection of magnetic field and misalignment of magnets will introduce various destructive effects on the performance of the machine. The possibility of correcting the errors should be thoroughly examined before settling the design. In this paper, we have tried to estimate the errors as realistic as possible based on the results obtained from the simulation of the elements and the accuracy of the predicted equipment for fabrication and alignment. The influence of errors on the lattice is investigated. Closed orbit distortion, beta beating and betatron coupling are corrected and improvement made in the lattice functions and machine performance will be presented.},

Several metrics are in common use, like optical signal-to-noise power ratio (OSNR), Q-factor, error vector magnitude (EVM) and bit error ratio (BER). A measured raw BER is not necessarily useful to predict the final BER after soft-decision forward error correction (FEC), if the statistics of the noise leading to errors is unknown. In this respect the EVM is superior, as it allows an estimation of the error statistics. We compare various metrics analytically, by simulation, and through experiments. We employ six quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) formats at symbol rates of 20 GBd and 25 GBd. The signals were generated by a software-defined transmitter. We conclude that for optical channels with additive Gaussian noise the EVM metric is a reliable quality measure. For nondata-aided QAM reception, BER in the range 10-6...10-2 can be reliably estimated from measured EVM.},

Here, we describe an oligonucleotide synthesis strategy that uses the template-independent polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT). Each TdT molecule is conjugated to a single deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) molecule that it can incorporate into a primer. After incorporation of the tethered dNTP, the 3′ end of the primer remains covalently bound to TdT and is inaccessible to other TdT–dNTP molecules. Cleaving the linkage between TdT and the incorporated nucleotide releases the primer and allows subsequent extension. We demonstrate that TdT–dNTP conjugates can quantitatively extend a primer by a single nucleotide in 10–20 s, and that the scheme can be iterated to write a defined sequence. This approach may form the basis of an enzymatic oligonucleotide synthesizer.},

In the LHC every fill is preceded by the injection of a pilot bunch with low intensity. Using the injection oscillations from the pilot bunch we are able to measure the coupling at each individual BPM. The measurement is used to calculate a global coupling correction. The correction is based on the use of two orthogonal knobs which correct the real and imaginary part of the difference resonance term f1001, respectively. This method to correct the betatron coupling has been proven successful during the normal operation of the LHC. This paper presents the method used to calculate the corrections and its performance.},

The transverse coupling is calculated from turn-by-turn data, exciting the beam with an ac dipole. By adjusting the momentum relative to the reference energy and repeating the measurement, we obtain the transverse coupling dependency on momentum. The measurements are compared to the predictions from the magnetic model, and show good agreement. We describe the algorithm used to calculate the corrections, which are performed using skew sextupoles in the LHC lattice. A reduction in the chromatic coupling of a factor 2.5±0.4 for beam 1 and 1.6 ±0.3 for beam 2 was obtained after applying the corrections.},

In this article we show recent advancements in methods and algorithms to measure and correct coupling. The benefit of using a more precise formula relating the resonance driving term f1001 to the ΔQmin is presented. The quality of the coupling measurements is increased, with about a factor 3, by selecting beam position monitor (BPM) pairs with phase advances close to π2 and through data cleaning using singular value decomposition with an optimal number of singular values. These improvements are beneficial for the implemented automatic coupling correction, which is based on injection oscillations, presented in the article. Furthermore, a proposed coupling feedback for the LHC is presented. The system will rely on the measurements from BPMs equipped with a new type of high resolution electronics, diode orbit and oscillation, which will be operational when the LHC restarts in 2015. The feedback will combine the coupling measurements from the available BPMs in order to calculate the best correction.},

A way to correct the errors using sextupo-lar correctors is referenced and how this could be integrated in the commissioning is outlined.

Various models have been proposed which improve over the GN model accuracy. One of them is the EGN model, which completely removes the Gaussianity approximation from all non-linear interference (NLI) components. The EGN model is, however, substantially more complex than the GN model. Recently, we proposed a simple closed-form formula which permits to approximate the EGN model, starting from the GN. It was however limited to all-identical, equispaced channels, and did not correct single-channel NLI (also called SCI). In this follow-up contribution, we propose an improved version which both allows to address non-identical channels and corrects the SCI contribution as well. Extensive simulative testing shows the new formula to be asymptotically very accurate, for sufficiently large number of spans. This is a preliminary document which will be followed by a journal submission.},

  abstract = {This MD is a follow-up study of MD1831, where single bunches were stabilized against impedance-driven instabilities at 6.5 TeV in the LHC with Q''. The goals are (i) to explore whether an amplitude detuning free Q'' knob can be implemented at injection energy, and (ii) whether Q'' can provide beam stability at injection, where the beams suffer mostly from electron cloud effects. Ideally, this would relax the use of the Landau octupoles and may help in preserving the beam quality by reducing dynamic aperture limitations originating from the octupoles. The MD has been split into two parts: First, optics corrections were put in place to minimize beta-beating and linear coupling introduced by the knobs. The corrections were achieved by means of orbit bumps and skew quadrupole knobs. Machine safety was then validated with loss maps. While the betatron loss maps were approved, the off-momentum maps showed a priori unexpected losses in several arcs and the MD was stopped at this point for reasons of machine protection. The second part of the MD, where the effect of Q'' in terms of the mitigation of collective effects was meant to be studied, could hence not be performed and may be addressed in a future MD.},

At RHIC, using the independent component analysis method, linear optical functions are extracted from the turn by turn beam position data of the ac dipole driven betatron oscillation. Despite the constraint of a limited number of available quadrupole correctors at RHIC, a global beta-beat correction scheme using a beta-beat response matrix method was developed and experimentally demonstrated. In both rings, a factor of 2 or better reduction of beta-beat was achieved within available beam time. At the same time, a new scheme of using horizontal closed orbit bump at sextupoles to correct beta-beat in the arcs was demonstrated in the Yellow ring of RHIC at beam energy of 255 GeV, and a peak beta-beat of approximately 7\% was achieved.},

In the latest generation machines, performance depends critically on the stability of the beam. In order to counteract disturbances due to magnetic imperfections, misalignments, ground motion, temperature changes and other dynamic effects, fully automated control of the key beam parameters â orbit, tune, coupling, chromaticity and energy â becomes an increasingly important aspect of accelerator operation.

The goal is to use the same correction approach for the different designs. The correction algorithm is based on the minimization of the differences between the IR transfer map with errors and the design IR transfer map. Its performance is tested using the dynamic aperture as a figure of merit. The relation between map coefficients and resonance terms is also given as a way to target particular resonances by selecting the right map coefficients. The dynamic aperture is studied versus magnet aperture using recently established relations between magnetic errors and magnet aperture.},

Normal forms and Lie algebra are powerful tools to study the nonlinear content of an accelerator lattice. In this article a way to obtain the normal form of the Hamiltonian of an accelerator with an ac dipole is described. The particle motion to first order in the nonlinearities is derived using Lie algebra techniques. The dependence of the Hamiltonian terms on the longitudinal coordinate is studied showing that they vary differently depending on the ac dipole parameters.

The linearized approximation is not valid for a variety of interesting systems, nor is it simple to extend to higher order. It is also well-known that the linearized approximation to the Vlasov equation is invalid for long times, due to its inability to correctly capture fine phase space structures. We derive a perturbation theory for the Vlasov equation based on the underlying Hamiltonian structure of the phase space evolution. We obtain an explicit perturbation series for a dressed Hamiltonian applicable to arbitrary systems whose dynamics can be described by the nonlinear Vlasov equation.},

  abstract = {The LHC is now operating with a tune separation of ∼0.004 in collision. This puts tight constraints on the allowed transverse coupling since a |C−| larger than a fraction of the fractional tune split may lead to beam instabilities. In the last years a new tool based on the ADT used in a similar way as an AC-dipole to excite the beam was developed. The ADT AC-dipole gives coherent oscillations without increasing the beam emittance. These oscillations are analyzed automatically to obtain the value of the coupling. A coupling measurement campaign was done in 2017 and while the correction converged and stayed rather constant over time it was observed that depending on the target bunch and filling scheme the results could vary by Δ|C−| ∼ 0.002. In this MD report we investigated 3 different bunches, one with Long Range Beam-Beam (LRBB) in IPs 1 and 5, one with LRBB in all IPs and one with no LRBB. The results indicate that there are differences in coupling between the bunches experiencing different LRBB. Furthermore, there is also a measurable difference in the tunes between the different bunches. A measurement of the emittance also shows that there is no observable increase of emittance from these measurement techniques},

New features such as combined ramp and squeeze, crossing angle and  levelling as well as ATS optics (Achromatic Telescopic Squeeze) were introduced in regular operation between 2016 and 2018. Lead ion, mixed proton-lead, intermediate proton energy, vdm calibration and high-beta runs were also performed with a large diversity of configurations and beam energies.

  abstract = {In circular machines, nonlinear dynamics can impact parameters such as beam lifetime and could result in limitations on the performance reach of the accelerator. Assessing and understanding these effects in experiments is essential to confirm the accuracy of the magnetic model and improve the machine performance. A direct measurement of the machine nonlinearities can be obtained by characterizing the dependency of the tune as a function of the amplitude of oscillations (usually defined as amplitude detuning). The conventional technique is to excite the beam to large amplitudes with a single kick and derive the tune from turn-by-turn data acquired with beam position monitors. Although this provides a very precise tune measurement it has the significant disadvantage of being destructive. An alternative, nondestructive way of exciting large amplitude oscillations is to use an ac dipole. The perturbation Hamiltonian in the presence of an ac dipole excitation shows a distinct behavior compared to the free oscillations which should be correctly taken into account in the interpretation of experimental data. The use of an ac dipole for direct amplitude detuning measurement requires careful data processing allowing one to observe the natural tune of the machine; the feasibility of such a measurement is demonstrated using experimental data from the Large Hadron Collider. An experimental proof of the theoretical derivations based on measurements performed at injection energy is provided as well as an application of this technique at top energy using a large number of excitations on the same beam.},

  abstract = {We present a novel statistical moments-based method for optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) monitoring in polarization-multiplexed (pol-mux) coherent optical systems. This technique only requires the knowledge of the envelope of the equalized signal before phase correction, which can be achieved by using any two arbitrary statistical moments, and it is suitable for both constant and non-constant modulus modulation formats. The proposed estimation method is experimentally demonstrated for 10-Gbaud pol-mux coherent systems using QPSK and 16-QAM. Additionally, numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate 20-Gbaud systems using 16-QAM and 64-QAM. The results show that the OSNR can be estimated accurately over a wide range of values for QPSK, 16-QAM or 64-QAM systems up to 1920-km long and with up to 50-ps all-order polarization mode dispersion. By setting a proper reference value for calibration, the proposed algorithm also shows good tolerance when the received signal is not well compensated.},

  abstract = {Particle physics has arrived at an important moment of its history. The discovery of the Higgs boson, with a mass of 125 GeV, completes the matrix of particles and interactions that has constituted the “Standard Model” for several decades. This model is a consistent and predictive theory, which has so far proven successful at describing all phenomena accessible to collider experiments. However, several experimental facts do require the extension of the Standard Model and explanations are needed for observations such as the abundance of matter over antimatter, the striking evidence for dark matter and the non-zero neutrino masses. Theoretical issues such as the hierarchy problem, and, more in general, the dynamical origin of the Higgs mechanism, do likewise point to the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model. This report contains the description of a novel research infrastructure based on a high-energy hadron collider, which extends the current energy frontier by almost a factor 2 (27 TeV collision energy) and an integrated luminosity of at least a factor of 3 larger than the HL-LHC. In connection with four experimental detectors, this infrastructure will deepen our understanding of the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking, allow a first measurement of the Higgs self-coupling, double the HL-LHC discovery reach and allow for in-depth studies of new physics signals arising from future LHC measurements. This collider would directly produce particles at significant rates at scales up to 12 TeV. The project re-uses the existing LHC underground infrastructure and large parts of the injector chain at CERN. This particle collider would succeed the HL-LHC directly and serve the world-wide physics community for about 20 years beyond the middle of the 21st century. The European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) update 2013 stated “To stay at the forefront of particle physics, Europe needs to be in a position to propose an ambitious post-LHC accelerator project at CERN by the time of the next Strategy update”. The FCC study has implemented the ESPP recommendation by developing a vision for an “accelerator project in a global context”. This document describes the detailed design and preparation of a construction project for a post-LHC circular high-energy hadron collider “in collaboration with national institutes, laboratories and universities worldwide”, and enhanced by a strong participation of industrial partners. Now, a coordinated preparation effort can be based on a core of an ever-growing consortium of already more than 135 institutes worldwide. The technology for constructing a High-Energy LHC can be brought to the technology readiness level required for construction within the coming ten years through a committed and focused R\&D programme. The concept comprises a power-saving, low-temperature superconducting magnet system based on an evolution of the Nb3Sn technology pioneered at the HL-LHC, an energy-efficient cryogenic refrigeration infrastructure based on a neon-helium (Nelium) light gas mixture, a high-reliability and low loss cryogen distribution infrastructure based on Invar, high-power distributed beam transfer using superconducting elements and local magnet energy recovery and re-use technologies that are already gradually introduced at other CERN accelerators. Re-use of the LHC underground civil infrastructure worth about 500 million CHF at the time of its construction, extension of the surface sites and use of the existing injector chain that also serve for a concurrently running physics programme are levers to come to a sustainable research infrastructure at the energy frontier. Strategic R\&D for HE-LHC aims at minimising construction cost and energy consumption, while maximising the socio-economic impact. It needs to mitigate technology-related risks and ensure that industry can benefit from an acceptable economic utility. Concerning the implementation, a preparatory phase of about eight years is both necessary and adequate to establish the project governance and organisation structures, to build the international machine and experiment consortia, to develop a territorial implantation plan considering the constraints emerging from using the existing infrastructure and the host states’ requirements, optimising the use of land, resources and preparing the construction project. Such a large-scale, international fundamental research infrastructure, tightly involving industrial partners and providing training at all education levels, will be a strong motor of economic and societal development in all participating nations. The FCC study has implemented a set of actions towards a coherent vision for the world-wide high-energy and particle physics community, providing a collaborative framework for topically complementary and geographically well-balanced contributions. This conceptual design report lays the foundation for a subsequent infrastructure preparatory and technical design phase.},
